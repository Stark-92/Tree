# Tree
C# algorithm to build a tree from given integer array that presents its parents and calculate its height and leaves.
The given integer array must be in ascending order.
For example the array is {-1,0,0,1,1,2}, the index starts from 0 to 5.
parent(0)=-1 that means the first element presents the root.
parent(1)=0 that means the parent of this node is the node with index 0 which is the root.
parent(2)=0 that means the parent of this node is the node with index 0 which is the root.
parent(3)=1 that means the parent of this node is the node with index 1 which is the left child for the root.
